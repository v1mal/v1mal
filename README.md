## Hi there 👋

I design and build production-ready WordPress systems, custom plugins, and automation-driven web platforms.

Currently building OpenScene, a structured community engine built on WordPress with custom tables, REST architecture, moderation systems, and hybrid SSR + SPA patterns.

What I Build

• High-ticket custom WordPress platforms
• Custom plugin architecture and data models
• Headless and hybrid WordPress systems
• Workflow automation systems
• Performance-focused production builds
